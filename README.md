# codeQuiz
In this assignment, we were asked to create a code quiz. Some specific features that were requested include when the user clicks on the start button, a timer would start and they would be presented with a question. When the user answers the question, they are presented with another question. If the user answers a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock. And then if all the answers are answered or if the timer reaches 0, then the game is over. When the game is over, they are able to save their initials and score. One particular issue I stumbled upon was trying to get the timer to stop after the game is complete.
